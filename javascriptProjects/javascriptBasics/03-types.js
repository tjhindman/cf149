// TYPES

// Anything on the right side of the assignment operator (=). They are the 'values', the data that we store for later. There are two types of data types (at least what we'll be going over today: Primitive and Complex).

// BOOLEANS
// A boolean has only two types of possible values: true or false.

let on = true;
console.log(on);

let off = false;
console.log(off);

// STRINGS
// Strings are going to represent plain text and will be wrapped in either single or double quotes.
// NOTE: We can use single or double quotes. JS can read them both as strings. HOWEVER, the opening quotation should match the closing quotation.

let quote = "Hello there!";
console.log(quote);

// let quotation = '"This is a quotation"';
let quotation = '"Hello there"';
console.log(quotation);

// COERCION - Is when JS assumes when we are adding a number and a string together that they are both gonna be strings.

// NULL
// Null acts as an empty container. It has nothing in it, but it still exists as a space to be filled.

let empty = null;
console.log(empty);

// UNDEFINED
// Undefined has NO value to be assigned and does NOT act as an empty container.
let correct;
console.log(correct);

// let incorrect = undefined;
// NOTE: You CAN technically do this, it's just not best practice.

// NULL VS UNDEFINED
// NUll is a container with nothing in it.
// UNDEFINED is a variable has not been assigned a value, nor has it been created yet.

// Think of a UPS store.
// Null is a package that has been assembled. It is waiting for something to be put inside of this assembled box.
// Undefined is a package that is not assembled yet. It still needs to be assembled and have something packed inside of it.
